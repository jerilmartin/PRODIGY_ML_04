# CNN Hand Gesture Recognition

## Quickstart
- **Dependencies**: Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, Pillow, matplotlib
- **Installation**: Run `pip install tensorflow numpy pandas pillow matplotlib`
- **Usage**: Execute `t4.py` to classify hand gestures from images.

## Overview
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is the "LeapGestRecog" dataset, available on Kaggle. To access and download the dataset, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog?select=leapGestRecog).

## Usage
1. **Data Loading**: Place the dataset in the appropriate directory.
2. **Script Execution**: Run the script:
   ```bash
   t4.py
3.**Visualization**: Training accuracy and loss graphs will be displayed to help in understanding the model's performance.
